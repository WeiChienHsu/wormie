## Usage

> Users can request videos at specific locations. Users who are near a desired location can respond to an open request and capture a video of the content that the other user requested. Once a request is fulfilled, all users of the application can view and browse the videos. Requests can have deadlines associated with them.

Current usecases involve capturing a subject or moment of interest at a specific location (e.g. "Is there a line outside this brunch spot right now?"), or a video between 2 separate points of interest (e.g. "I'd like to see a video of walking across the Golden Gate Bridge.")
